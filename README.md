# Mini ebay-like auction

A small piece of code based on channels to demonstrate how to create
simple auctions in oTree

EDIT my Maxim:
The (ultimate) goal is to have an auction with two stages:
Stage 1: People can exchange bids, until everyone agrees that they don't want to place any more bids.
Stage 2: People can make on final bid, which is accepted with a certain probability only. If anyone does this, and the bid is successful, everyone gets back to stage one, and can start the bid war again.
Hereby late bidding and sniping in ebay auctions was simulated in 1993 or so.
How I save the results and hte bids I am not sure yet, but 

What I actually want to do now:
Simple second price auction, one stage. People can place their bid, and then see if they are the winner, and how high the current (second) price the winner has to pay is.
